# Building Your Business on AWS with AI Agent

Welcome to this series! You're likely curious about what "the cloud" really means and how Amazon Web Services (AWS) can help you build amazing things online. Perhaps you have a business idea, want to create an application, or are looking to understand the technology that powers much of the internet today. You're in the right place.

Trying to understand AWS can sometimes feel like looking at a giant map with hundreds of roads and destinations. It's powerful, but it can also seem a bit overwhelming at first. The goal of this series is to give you a clear, friendly, and practical starting point. We want to show you how to use AWS, not just tell you about it.

To make things practical and fun, we'll build a fictional online business together throughout this series: the "Cloud Coffee Shop." Imagine customers ordering their favorite coffee and snacks online for pickup or delivery. Think about the staff managing those orders and keeping the menu up-to-date. We'll use this everyday example to explore how different AWS services work and, more importantly, how they work together.

We'll start with the very basics: What is cloud computing? What is AWS? Then, step by step, we'll cover how to:

* Keep your AWS account safe.
* Design a private network in the cloud for your business.
* Choose the right virtual servers to run your applications.
* Manage your data and databases effectively.
* Store things like images and files.
* Make sure your application can handle many users and keep running smoothly.
* Keep an eye on how everything is performing and manage your costs.

**Using AI Agent for Infrastructure Provisioning**

Throughout this series, we'll use an innovative approach to provision AWS infrastructure. Instead of manually clicking through the AWS Console UI (which can be time-consuming and difficult to recreate consistently) or writing complex Terraform code (which requires significant coding skills), we'll leverage the power of an [AI Infrastructure Agent](https://github.com/VersusControl/ai-infrastructure-agent).

This AI Agent allows you to describe your infrastructure needs in plain English and automatically provisions the necessary AWS resources. This approach offers several advantages:

* **No coding required**: Simply describe what you want to build
* **Consistent deployments**: Easy to recreate infrastructure for each chapter

This series is for anyone who wants to learn AWS from the ground up. You don't need to be a tech wizard to get started. By the time you finish, you'll have a solid understanding of core AWS services, and a clear idea of how to plan and build your own applications in the cloud.

So, let's begin this journey. We're excited to help you learn how to use the power of AWS to bring your ideas to life!

If you’re enjoying this series and find it helpful, I'd love for you to like and share it! Thank you so much!
