# 10 AI Prompts Every DevOps Engineer Should Bookmark

*The exact prompts that transformed my infrastructure workflow from hours to minutes*

Today, I'm sharing the 10 battle-tested prompts that have transformed my DevOps workflow and prevented countless production incidents. These aren't just prompts‚Äîthey're your new DevOps superpowers.

## The Difference Between Amateur and Professional Prompts

**Amateur Prompt:** "Create a CI/CD pipeline"
**Professional Prompt:** "Act as a senior DevOps engineer. Create a GitLab CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application that includes security scanning, automated testing, and blue-green deployment to AWS ECS. Include proper error handling and rollback mechanisms."

See the difference? The professional prompt follows the **C.R.A.F.T. framework** I've mentioned before:

- **Context**: Node.js app, AWS ECS, GitLab
- **Role**: Senior DevOps engineer
- **Action**: Create CI/CD pipeline
- **Format**: Complete pipeline with specific features
- **Tone**: Professional, production-ready

Now, let's dive into the prompts that will revolutionize your workflow.

**Copy this prompt:**

```
Act as a certified cloud security architect. Analyze the following infrastructure code and provide a detailed security audit report. Focus on:
- Security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
- Compliance gaps (SOC2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Performance bottlenecks
- Best practices violations

Format the response as an executive summary followed by detailed findings with remediation steps and priority levels.

## Pro Tips for Maximum Impact

### 1. Create Your Prompt Library

Save these prompts in a dedicated folder or note-taking app. I use Obsidian with tags for quick searching.

### 2. Customize for Your Stack

Replace the generic placeholders with your actual technology stack. The more specific, the better the results.

### 3. Build on Previous Responses

Don't just use the first response. Ask follow-up questions like:

- "What are the potential risks of this approach?"
- "How would this scale to 10x the current load?"
- "What monitoring would you add for this?"

### 4. Validate Everything

AI is powerful but not infallible. Always review and test generated code before deploying to production.

### 5. Create Your Own Prompts

Use these as templates. The best prompts are the ones you create for your specific use cases.

## The Compound Effect of Great Prompts

Here's what happened when I started using these prompts consistently:

**Week 1:** Saved 5 hours on infrastructure reviews
**Week 2:** Caught 3 security issues before deployment
**Week 3:** Automated 4 manual processes
**Week 4:** Reduced incident response time by 50%

**After 3 months:** Our team's productivity increased by 40%, and we had zero security incidents.
